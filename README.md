## introduction

This repository features an advanced simulation of an assembly line, implemented using C++. The project is a testament to my proficiency in object-oriented programming, system design, and software development.

## Project Overview
The "Advanced C++ Assembly Line Simulator" is an intricate application that mimics a real-world assembly line. It involves multiple stations, each responsible for handling specific items and fulfilling customer orders. The simulation covers the entire workflow from order initiation to completion, highlighting the complexities of managing an assembly line in a software environment.

## Project Components
**Utilities and Station Classes**: These components are fundamental to the simulation, with Utilities handling the parsing of input files and Stations managing individual sections of the assembly line.

**CustomerOrder Module**: This module manages the customer orders as they move through the assembly line, ensuring that each station fulfills its part of the order.

**Workstation Module**: This component represents active stations on the assembly line. Each workstation is responsible for a specific part of the order processing, managing the flow and fulfillment of orders.

**LineManager Module**: The core of the assembly line simulation, this module configures and oversees the entire line. It ensures that orders are processed efficiently, moving through each station and ultimately determining if orders are completed or incomplete.

Each of these components plays a vital role in simulating an efficient and functional assembly line, showcasing a deep understanding of both the conceptual and practical aspects of object-oriented programming in C++.
